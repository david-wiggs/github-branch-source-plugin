    Enable passthrough authentication for GitHub repositories. When enabled, Jenkins will send username/password 
    credentials to an external authentication service to obtain GitHub tokens dynamically.

    This is useful when you want to centralize authentication through an external system that can provide 
    repository-specific tokens based on user credentials.
